How to use:

Installation:
Place the advancedfx_import_bvh.py file
in the "SourceFilmmaker\game\platform\scripts\sfm\animset" folder.

Usage:
1. Edit a clip
2. Add a camera: Right click in empty space on Animation Set Editor and select
   "Create Animation Set for New Camera"
3. Right click the camera and select Rig advancedfx_import_bvh
The import will not set the correct FOV for the camera (the BVH file also does
not contain FOV information), that is left up to the
pros atm (maybe I will make a feature for that in the future).
Also be aware that CS:GO actually uses an higher FOV than you set:

advancedfx_export_bvh is still in the making (sorry).
